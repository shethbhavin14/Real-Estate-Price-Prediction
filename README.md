# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

Problem: Avoiding manually predictions of prices based on previous data with less accuracy.
Goal: Prediction of prices with best possible accuracy.
DataSet: UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Total Columns: 14 (13 - Features, 1 - Label)

Steps:
  1. Conversion of Data into csv format.
  2. Importing python libraries.
  3. Reading the csv file.
  4. Using Pandas functions to check for missing values, summary and statistics of the data.
  5. Plotting graphs to find more imformation on the data.
  6. Splitting Train & Test Data using scikit library or functions.
  7. Strafied Sampling for better sampling from different sub groups.
  8. Checking correlation matrix between all the columns and sorting values according to correlations.
  9. Creating Pipeline to make a proper flow.
  10. Using imputers as Estimators, standard scaler for Feature Scaling as Transformers.
  11. Selecing Models for Predictions.
  12. Testing and Evaluating Models like Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression.
  13. Using Cross-validation to avoid overfitting of Model.
  14. Using Root Mean Squared Error to see Loss Function.
  15. Selecting desired Model after checking the best possible accuracy.
  16. Testing the Model with the Test dataset.
  17. Saving the Model using joblib.
  18. Using the Model using joblib.

Above steps are basically:
  1. Data Collection.
  2. Data Cleaning.
  3. Data Visualization.
  4. Exploratory Data Analysis.
  5. Model Planning. 
  6. Model Building.
  7. Model Deployment.
